				Empower the user to quickly accomplish goals by implementing an interface that is
				light, responsive, and focused on primary tasks. Make sure every element is there
				for a reason. Deliberately use clean typography and simple animations to keep the
				work flow fluid, giving the user a perception of performance and synergy.

				Move beyond the ‘usable’ interface to a more intuitive, human interface; one
				designed to naturally flow with the user’s tendencies and that has the user’s needs
				as the primary focus. Communicate openly and humanly to engage and inform the
				user. Make our users the heroes by providing a product tailored to their needs and
				goals. Our products don’t do amazing things; our users do amazing things with our
				products
