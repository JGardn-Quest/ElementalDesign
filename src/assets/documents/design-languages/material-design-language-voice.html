				Writing style (what is said) and tone (how it’s said) make up the voice of our products. That voice is used to connect with our users on an emotional level. It is often seen as the attitude or personality of the product, and defines our relationship with the user.

				<li class="docs-markdown-li">
					<strong>Keep It Concise</strong> – Be brief, but make sure the user is given the information he/she needs. Describe only what is necessary. Minor details and subtle differences will be lost on most users and will muddle the message.
				</li>
				<li class="docs-markdown-li">
					<strong>Keep It Real</strong> – Use words you would use in a real-life conversation with someone who is intelligent, but might not know technical jargon. If your text doesn’t read the way you would say it in an actual conversation, it’s likely not the right choice of words.
				</li>
				<li class="docs-markdown-li">
					<strong>Keep It Friendly</strong> – Use contractions and speak directly to the user. Don’t be abrupt, annoying, or accusatory; but encouraging and straightforward. Where appropriate, use a light and inspiring tone.
